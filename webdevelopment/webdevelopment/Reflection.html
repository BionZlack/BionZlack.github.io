        <h2>Brief Glimpse into 'The Greatest': </h2>
        <p>My collegiate career as a student has been defined by several side hustles and my pursuit of becoming the best which has driven me to not bog myself down with perfectionism but accept the challenge of rigidity. This philosophy started with Black Jack Sneakers which taught me how to develop market expertise and how to act on perform analysis based on trends. This was realized by the rise and fall of the sneaker reselling sub-culture and side hustle that caused a lot of havoc during the pandemic. Black Jack Sneakers taught me that popularity is more than just vanity metrics and that something doesn’t have to be on the front page to have massive market value. Black Jack Sneakers was a clever way to get around my mother’s rules about balancing employment and school, during a time when having the extra couple of dollars to go out with friends made all the difference. 

            <br>
            <br>The skills I gained as a Sneaker Reseller/Concierge developed advanced communication and selling skills which set me apart as a Sales Representative at River Cut Gold Course, also known as a Bev Cart Boy. My skills in quick sales interactions were first impressions that made the difference between driving around hopelessly in hot weather and the cool relief of a crisp dollar bill. This role allowed me to develop the skills to talk to anyone from a wide range of cultural, regional, and socio-economic backgrounds and create a passion for people. These skills translated really well into my role as a Fraternity and Sorority Life Ambassador where I’d have to navigate a wider array of backgrounds in a professional and academic setting.
            <br>
                <br>Working in a fraternity and sorority life at the University of Missouri, where over 25% of the student population is involved in fraternity and sorority life is an impactful role that puts me in the same rooms as change makers around campus. In a new environment where first impressions mattered, however, creating long-term relationships goes a whole lot further. Beyond talking to members of other fraternities, sororities, clubs, and faculty I also had to talk to prospective students and their parents who had their fair share of concerns. This role instilled a lot of self-confidence and the charisma that comes with it, allowing me to maneuver masterfully through professional spaces with bureaucratic processes and chains of command.

                <br>
                <br>All of these roles came to a paramount in my role as a Loan Specialist at Veterans United Home Loans (NMLS #1907)( NMLS ID#2604696) where I would make ‘warm’ calls to potential home buyers to sell them on financing their home purchase with Veterans United. When following up on a lead very limited information was known, typically limited to: name, current address, phone number, and veteran status. However, information wasn’t always accurate and way to narrow to come up with a sure-fire sales pitch to their demographic in the 10 seconds the phone was ringing. This taught me how to sense the tone of a conversation and use murky information to build an accurate customer profile without knowing all of the information. Something that makes Veterans United stand out is our very human approach to the home-buying process and how personal we keep it, taking notes on buyer interest, life events, and even family structure to tailor the experience to their lives. These roles have all come together to make me a holistic, well-rounded analyst.
