                    <p>As an upcoming Area Manager Intern at Amazon (Summer 2025), I will oversee operations within a fulfillment center, leading a team of associates to ensure efficient order processing, inventory management, and process improvement. My responsibilities will include monitoring workflow, analyzing productivity metrics, and implementing solutions to optimize safety, quality, and delivery speed. Through hands-on leadership, I will gain exposure to Amazon’s operational excellence frameworks, including Lean and Six Sigma principles, while driving team engagement and performance in a fast-paced logistics environment.</p>
                    <p><b>Reflection (Anticipated):</b> Although I haven’t started yet, I expect this internship to strengthen my leadership, problem-solving, and data-driven decision-making skills. I’m eager to learn how Amazon scales its world-class operations and to apply classroom knowledge (like supply chain management) in real time. Leading a diverse team will push me to adapt my communication style and foster collaboration under pressure. I hope to leave with a deeper understanding of logistics innovation and how to balance efficiency with employee engagement—a crucial skill for my future career in operations or entrepreneurship.</p>

                <div class="VUbody">
                    <p>As a Loan Specialist Intern at Veterans United Home Loans, I assisted in processing VA home loans, ensuring compliance with federal regulations, and supporting loan officers with client communications and documentation. My role included reviewing financial records, verifying borrower eligibility, and coordinating with underwriters to streamline the loan approval process. A major accomplishment was becoming the <em><b>youngest mortgage loan originator in the U.S., earning my NMLS license at 19</b></em>. This achievement demonstrated my dedication to mastering the mortgage industry while balancing regulatory requirements and client needs.</p>
                    <p><b>Reflection:</b> This internship deepened my understanding of mortgage lending, particularly VA loans. Earning my MLO license early showcased my ability to grasp complex financial concepts quickly. Working alongside experienced professionals improved my attention to detail and client service skills. The fast-paced environment taught me resilience and adaptability, preparing me for future finance roles. Veterans United’s emphasis on serving veterans also reinforced the importance of ethical lending practices.</p>

                <div class="BJSbody">
                    <p>At 15, I founded Black Jack Sneakers during the peak of the sneaker resale boom (2020). I specialized in sourcing limited-edition sneakers through strategic drops, raffles, and bulk deals, then reselling them on platforms like StockX, GOAT, and eBay. Within months, the business scaled rapidly, <em><b>generating over $50,000 in revenue with a 40% profit margin.</b></em> I handled everything—market research, pricing, authentication, shipping, and customer service—while leveraging social media (Instagram, TikTok) to build a loyal buyer network. My keen eye for trends and quick decision-making allowed me to capitalize on high-demand releases before prices surged.</p>
                    <p><b>Reflection:</b> Starting Black Jack Sneakers taught me entrepreneurship, financial discipline, and adaptability. The fast-moving resale market required constant research, risk assessment, and negotiation skills. Flipping sneakers also sharpened my understanding of supply/demand, branding, and e-commerce logistics. The biggest challenge was balancing school with a rapidly growing business, but the experience proved that hustle and market awareness pay off. Though I eventually shifted focus, the skills I gained—sales, marketing, and independent problem-solving—remain invaluable in my professional growth.</p>
