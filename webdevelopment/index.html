        <b>Welcome to Zion Black’s professional page!</b> This website contains an in-depth look at some of the many projects and proposals 
        I have tastefully curated throughout my career as a college data analyst and social media personality. These projects highlight 
        the curiosity and courage it takes to question the status quo understanding of how things work and provide examples of the 
        advancements that my expertise will bring to your team.
