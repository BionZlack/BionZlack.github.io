          <b>I am Zion Joseph Black,</b> a second-year scholar at the University of Missouri-Columbia studying Economics on a <em>full-ride scholarship</em>.
          Coming from the home of the Kentucky Derby, Muhammed Ali, and Bluegrass music; my old Kentucky Home, of Louisville, KY, made the need to be 'The Greatest' my goal from a young age.
          Since moving to college and being on campus I have honed my skills and acumen to make myself into a stand-out student on a campus of over 30,000.
          I have achieved this through building reliable interpersonal relationships with students and faculty from all walks of life which have refined my worldview and bettered my problem-solving abilities by giving me a fresh perspective to approach age-old challenges without reinventing the wheel.
          My goal at college has been to inspire other students who look like me to step out of their comfort zone and reach for the stars by hosting professional etiquette workshops and networking opportunities for first and second-generation college students to help them get a leg up on their careers.
          As I continue to shoot for the moon and reach for the stars I am sure not to forget those at basecamp who helped me all along the way.
